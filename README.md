We analyze the contact density of amino acids within the protein
structures, which indicates the compactness of amino acid packing. A predictive model is being
developed to assess whether an amino acid is densely packed based on its spatial surroundings. This
analysis is essential for exploring the potential of packing density as a predictor of protein disorder â€” a
key factor in understanding protein functionality and interaction dynamics.

The ultimate goal of this research is to apply this model to enhance the prediction of protein disorder,
thereby offering new insights into the structure-function relationship in proteins and advancing the fields
of structural biology and bioinformatics.
